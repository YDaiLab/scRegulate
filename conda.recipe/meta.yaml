  summary: Python Toolkit for Transcription Factor Activity Inference and Clustering of scRNA-seq Data
  description: |
    scRegulate is a Python toolkit designed for inferring transcription factor activity
    and clustering single-cell RNA-seq data using variational inference with biological priors.
    It is built on PyTorch and Scanpy, and supports CUDA acceleration for high-performance inference.
